what is the role of oral contraceptives (ocs) in the etiology of breast cancer?,"one of the most widely studied factors in breast cancer etiology is the use of exogenous hormones in the form of oral contraceptives (ocs) and hormone replacement therapy (hrt). the overall evidence suggests an approximately 25 greater risk of breast cancer among current users of ocs. the risk appears to decrease with age and time since oc discontinuance. for oc users, risk returns to that of the average population risk about 10 years after cessation.",oral contraceptives OCs,https://www.medscape.com/answers/1947145-155260/what-is-the-role-of-oral-contraceptives-ocs-in-the-etiology-of-breast-cancer,2025-06-21 22:19:34.186201,14,75

Can we do hormone receptor testing,"er testing of invasive breast cancers by validated immunohistochemistry remains the standard for predicting which patients may benefit from endocrine therapy; no other assays are recommended for this purpose. breast cancer samples with 1 to 100 of tumor nuclei positive should be interpreted as er positive. however, data on the benefit of endocrine therapy for cancers with 1-10 of cells staining er positive are limited. samples with these results should be reported using a new reporting category, er low positive, with a recommended comment. a sample is considered er negative if 1 or 0 of tumor cell nuclei are immunoreactive.",hormone receptor testing,https://www.medscape.com/answers/1947145-197610/what-were-the-ascocap-guidelines-for-hormone-receptor-testing-in-patients-with-breast-cancer,2025-06-21 22:19:34.186201,6,100

histologic findings of infiltrating lobular carcinoma breast cancer,"infiltrating lobular carcinoma has a much lower incidence than infiltrating ductal carcinoma, accounting for 15-20 of invasive breast cancers. histologically, it is characterized by the ""single-file"" arrangement of small tumor cells. like ductal carcinoma, infiltrating lobular carcinoma typically metastasizes to axillary lymph nodes first. however, it also has a tendency to be multifocal and have discontinuous areas of involvement, making mammographic and even mri staging imprecise.",infiltrating lobular,https://www.medscape.com/answers/1947145-155322/what-are-the-histologic-findings-of-infiltrating-lobular-carcinoma-breast-cancer,2025-06-21 22:19:34.186201,8,66
