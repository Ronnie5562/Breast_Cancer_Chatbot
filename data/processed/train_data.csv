role of tamoxifen and raloxifene for the reduction of breast cancer risk,"two selective estrogen receptor modulators (serms), tamoxifen and raloxifene, are approved for reduction of breast cancer risk in high-risk women. two nsabp trials (p1 and p2) showed that tamoxifen reduced the risk of ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive breast cancer by 30-50. in the nsabp p2 prevention trial, raloxifene was as effective as tamoxifen in reducing the risk of invasive breast cancer but was 30 less effective than tamoxifen in reducing the risk of ductal carcinoma in situ. tamoxifen and raloxifene are equally effective in reducing the risk of estrogen receptor negativepositive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. raloxifene is associated with lower rates of thromboembolic disease, benign uterine conditions, and cataracts than tamoxifen is. the evidence does not allow determination of whether either agent decreases mortality from breast cancer.",tamoxifen raloxifene,https://www.medscape.com/answers/1947145-155372/what-is-the-role-of-tamoxifen-and-raloxifene-for-the-reduction-of-breast-cancer-risk,2025-06-21 22:19:34.186201,12,130

ASBrS recommendations for contralateral prophylactic mastectomy in the treatment of breast cancer,"a consensus statement from the american society of breast surgeons (asbrs) recommends that women with unilateral breast cancer who are at average risk should be discouraged from undergoing a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (cpm), because most of those women, with the possible exception of brca carriers, will not obtain a survival benefit, and cpm doubles the risk of surgical complications. however, the asbrs advises that the final decision whether or not to proceed with contralateral prophylactic mastectomy is a result of the balance between benefits and risks of cpm and patient preference.",contralateral prophylactic mastectomy ASBrS,https://www.medscape.com/answers/1947145-155375/what-are-the-asbrs-recommendations-for-contralateral-prophylactic-mastectomy-cpm-in-the-treatment-of-breast-cancer,2025-06-21 22:19:34.186201,12,91

role of postoperative imaging in the long-term monitoring of breast cancer,"women who have had surgery for breast cancer may still require breast cancer screening with mammography. if a woman had a total mastectomy, then the other breast requires yearly follow-up, because there is still a higher risk that cancer will develop in the remaining breast. if the woman had a subcutaneous mastectomy, partial mastectomy, or lumpectomy, then that breast itself requires follow-up mammography. the first mammogram is best performed 6 months postoperatively to provide a baseline for the new postoperative and postirradiation changes. thereafter, mammography may be performed every 6-12 months for screening and follow-up",long-term monitoring,https://www.medscape.com/answers/1947145-155378/what-is-the-role-of-postoperative-imaging-in-the-long-term-monitoring-of-breast-cancer,2025-06-21 22:19:34.186201,11,95
